This package calls a limited subset of Reddit’s API in order to gather
information on threads, subreddits, and users.

Under the hood, it calls Python’s PRAW library via the reticulate
package.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("acastroaraujo/rawr")
```
