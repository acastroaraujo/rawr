This package calls a limited subset of Reddit's API in order to gather information on threads, subreddits, and users. 

Under the hood, it calls Python's [__PRAW__](https://praw.readthedocs.io/) library via the [__reticulate__](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.

RAWR stands for __Reddit Api Wrapper for R__.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("acastroaraujo/rawr")
```
