This package gives you access to Reddit's API in order to gather information on _threads_, _subreddits_, and _users._ 

Under the hood, it calls Python's [__PRAW__](https://praw.readthedocs.io/) library via the [__reticulate__](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.

RAWRR stands for __Reddit API Wrapper for R using Reticulate__ ;)

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("acastroaraujo/rawrr")
```

It currently has these functions:

- `install_praw()`: A simple wrapper for `reticulate::py_install("praw", method = method, conda = conda)`

- `init_reddit(username, password, client_id, client_secret)`

- `download_sub_urls()`: Download urls by subreddit

- `download_keyword_urls()`: Download urls by search query

- `extract_thread()`: Extract a thread from a path

- `add_threads()`	Add thread information to a data frame, like the one produced by the `download_*_urls()` functions

- `create_aff_net()`: Create a bipartite network of users and recent subreddits from a list of users

- `user_net()`: Create a network of user interactions from a data frame, like the one produced by `add_threads()`
